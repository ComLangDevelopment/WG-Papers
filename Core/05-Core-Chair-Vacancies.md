# Cannon Language Core WG 
Report Concerning Governance Amendment #11


## From Governance:
“Establish, and document through an approved report, the mechanism under which vacancies in any chair position may be filled, when such vacancies need to be filled, and how the authorities and responsibilities of any chair position are exercised when that chair position is vacant, subject to policy established by the particular working group.”

01. The Process Under Which Vacancies May Be Filled
Should there be a vacancy in any Working Group Chair position, there shall be an election held to fill this position.
The terms of this election are as follows:
To be eligible to vote in the election, one must be a member of the Cannon Discord server, and must have been a member of the server for at least 2 weeks prior to the election.
Any member of the Discord server may nominate themselves for the position, unless they have already been deemed ineligible through other means.
All nominations and voting will take place via Google Forms, which are set up by the Project Manager.
The nomination period will be at least 1 week before the election, nominees may campaign for themselves throughout this period.
All voting will be open for 24 hours on the day of the election.

## 02. When Such Vacancies Must Be Filled
Once a vacancy occurs, the Project Manager shall seek to start the nomination period no later than 1 week after the vacancy. This ensures that the vacancy is filled in at most 2 weeks’ time.

## 03. How the Responsibilities and Authorities of the Chair Position are Exercised When a Chair Position is Vacant
When a chair position is vacant, the Project Manager will be immediately considered as the acting chair of that Working Group. The Project Manager still retains one vote during this time. Note that this item is subject to specific policy documented by the working group in question.

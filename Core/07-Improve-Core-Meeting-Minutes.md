# Improve Core Meeting Minutes

For the purpose of improving the quality of Minutes produced during Meetings of the Core Working Group, the following shall be included in the rules of Order of the Core Working Group:
1. During Meetings of the Core Working Group, a competent member of the working group who consents to do so, shall take minutes for the meeting, which shall be made available to members of the working group within 48 hours following the meeting. This member may be selected by motion, or determined by the Chair or Acting Chair. This shall not preclude other members of the Core Working Group from contributing to the same.
2. The minutes above shall, for all procedural and approval items, include the name or pseduonym of the the member who moves the item, the member who seconds, any member who is recognized for discussion of the item, a summary of the discussion, if any, and the ultimate result of the motion. The procedural item of appointing a speaker shall also indicate the name or pseduonym of the member who is moved to be the speaker. 
3. The minutes above shall, for discussion items, include a summary of the discussion. 
4. The minutes shall otherwise indicate the start and end date and time of the meeting, the convener of the meeting, the minute taker as per item (1), and members in attendance. 
5. Nothing in the above requirements shall preclude the minute taker from including additional information in the minutes.
6. During the subsequent meeting of the Core Working Group, the minutes taken from the previous meeting shall be discussed and considered for approval, and if approved, the Project Manager shall publish those minutes to a publically accessible location they shall deem suitable. The Acting Chair may perform this action on behalf of the Project Manager.


The above shall not apply to meetings conducted by the Core Working Group before the date May 9th, 2021, but this shall not preclude the minutes from such meetings from including the information prescribed above.

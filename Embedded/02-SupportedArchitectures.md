# Embedded WG Supported Architectures

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of  architectures which are explicitly supported by the Embedded Working Group,
 in collaberation with the Compiler Development Working Group. 

* x86, including x86-16, and x86-64
* ARM
* AVR, conditioned on Harvard Achitecture support from Lang Design
* RISC-V
* 65816

At least one non-hosted target for each of the above architectures will be available in the compiler.
